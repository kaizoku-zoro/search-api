For a positive, eveneven integer NN, we call a pair of arrays AA and BB to be interesting if they satisfy the following conditions :

|A|=|B|=N/2|A|=|B|=N/2 i.e. the length of array AA is equal to the length of array BB.
Each integer from 11 to NN occurs exactly once in exactly one of the arrays.
The ithith prefix sum of AA is not equal to ithith prefix sum of BB for all 1≤i≤N/2−11≤i≤N/2−1. Formally, ∑j=1iAj≠∑j=1iBj∑j=1iAj≠∑j=1iBj for all 1≤i≤N/2−11≤i≤N/2−1
Sum of all elements in AA is equal to sum of all elements in BB i.e. ∑j=1N/2Aj=∑j=1N/2Bj∑j=1N/2Aj=∑j=1N/2Bj

You are given a positive, even integer NN. If there exists an interesting pair of arrays, then print "YES" followed by an interesting pair for this given NN. If there exists multiple interesting pairs of arrays for given NN, you can print any. Print "NO" in a single line if no such pair exists.
Input Format

First line of input will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, the integer NN.

Output Format
For each test case, if there exists an interesting pair of arrays, say (A,B)(A,B), then in the first line print "YES", in the second line print array AA separated by spaces, and in third line print array BB separated by spaces. Print "NO" in a single line if no such pair exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
NN is guaranteed to be even.
Sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 106106

Explanation
Test case 2: Consider A=[1,4]A=[1,4] and B=[2,3]B=[2,3]. Every integer from 11 to 44 occurs exactly once in exactly one of the arrays. Also, 11st prefix sum of AA is not equal to 11st prefix sum of BB (1≠21≠2). And sum of the elements is equal to 55 for both arrays. So, (A,B)(A,B) is an interesting pair.
