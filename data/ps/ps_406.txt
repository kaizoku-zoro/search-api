Alice and Bob are walking on an infinite straight street. Initially, both are at the position X=0X=0 and they start walking in the direction of increasing XX. After NN seconds, they stop. Let's denote Alice's speed and Bob's speed during the ii-th of these seconds by AiAi and BiBi respectively.
Sometimes, Alice and Bob walk together, i.e. with the same speed side by side. Let's define the weird distance as the total distance they walk this way. Find this weird distance.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the total weird distance. It can be proved that this distance is an integer.

Explanation
Example case 1:

Alice and Bob walk side by side during the first second, from X=0X=0 to X=1X=1.
Then, Alice starts walking faster than Bob, so they do not walk side by side during second 22. At the end of second 22, Alice is at X=4X=4, while Bob is at X=3X=3.
During the next second, they again do not walk side by side, but Bob walks faster, so they both end up at X=7X=7.
During the last second, they both walk side by side and the distance they walk is 44.
Alice and Bob walk side by side during the 11-st and 44-th second and the total weird distance they travel is 1+4=51+4=5.

Example case 2:

First, Alice walks with speed 22 and Bob walks with speed 33, so they do not walk side by side. Alice ends up at X=2X=2, while Bob ends up at X=3X=3 at the end of the 11-st second.
Then, Alice walks with speed 33 and Bob walks with speed 22, so they do not walk side by side either.
Although Alice and Bob both end up at X=5X=5 at the end of the 22-nd second, the weird distance is 00.

Example case 3: We can see that Alice and Bob always walk together, so the weird distance is 3+3=63+3=6.
