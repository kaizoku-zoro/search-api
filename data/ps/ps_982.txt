You are given a positive integer NN. Consider the sequence S=(1,2,…,N)S=(1,2,…,N). You should choose two elements of this sequence and swap them.
A swap is nice if there is an integer MM (1≤M<N1≤M<N) such that the sum of the first MM elements of the resulting sequence is equal to the sum of its last N−MN−M elements. Find the number of nice swaps.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of nice swaps.
