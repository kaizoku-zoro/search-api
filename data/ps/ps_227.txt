Chef usually likes to play cricket, but now, he is bored of playing it too much, so he is trying new games with strings. Chef's friend Dustin gave him binary strings SS and RR, each with length NN, and told him to make them identical. However, unlike Dustin, Chef does not have any superpower and Dustin lets Chef perform only operations of one type: choose any pair of integers (i,j)(i,j) such that 1≤i,j≤N1≤i,j≤N and swap the ii-th and jj-th character of SS. He may perform any number of operations (including zero).
For Chef, this is much harder than cricket and he is asking for your help. Tell him whether it is possible to change the string SS to the target string RR only using operations of the given type.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a binary string SS.
The third line contains a binary string RR.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to change SS to RR or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤4001≤T≤400
1≤N≤1001≤N≤100
|S|=|R|=N|S|=|R|=N
SS and RR will consist of only '1' and '0'


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
5
11000
01001
3
110
001



                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
NO


Explanation
Example case 1: Chef can perform one operation with (i,j)=(1,5)(i,j)=(1,5). Then, SS will be "01001", which is equal to RR.
Example case 2: There is no sequence of operations which would make SS equal to RR.
