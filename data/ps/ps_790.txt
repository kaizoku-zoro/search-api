On her way to ChefLand, Marichka noticed 10K10K road signs (numbered 00 through 10K−110K−1). For each valid ii, the sign with number ii had the integer ii written on one side and 10K−i−110K−i−1 written on the other side.
Now, Marichka is wondering — how many road signs have exactly two distinct decimal digits written on them (on both sides in total)? Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.
For example, if K=3K=3, the two integers written on the road sign 363363 are 363363 and 636636, and they contain two distinct digits 33 and 66, but on the road sign 362362, there are integers 362362 and 637637, which contain four distinct digits — 22, 33, 66 and 77. On the road sign 1111, there are integers 1111 and 988988, which contain three distinct digits — 11, 99 and 88.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer KK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of road signs with exactly two digits, modulo 109+7109+7.
