Alice initially has a string SS of length NN, and she decides to modify it! Her modification consists of KK steps numbered from 11 to KK. In the ii-th step, Alice reverses the prefix of length ii of SS.
For example, suppose Alice starts with S=abfertyS=abferty, and she modifies it via 33 steps, then:

After the first step, abferty→S=abfertyabferty→S=abferty
After the second step, abferty→S=bafertyabferty→S=baferty
After the third step, baferty→S=fabertybaferty→S=faberty
So after 33 steps, her string becomes S=fabertyS=faberty.

After performing her KK-step modification, Alice ends up with the string S′S′. Now she challenges you to find the original string SS. Can you do it?
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of the test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK - the length of the string and the number of steps in Alice's modification.
The second line of the test case contains S′S′ - the final string obtained after the modification.

Output Format
For each test case, output the original string SS.

Explanation

Test case 22: The modification steps from SS to S′S′ is as follow:
11-st step: aababba→S=aababbaaababba→S=aababba
22-nd step: aababba→S=aababbaaababba→S=aababba
33-rd step: aababba→S=baaabbaaababba→S=baaabba
44-th step: baaabba→S=aaabbbabaaabba→S=aaabbba
55-th step: aaabbba→S=bbaaabaaaabbba→S=bbaaaba
Test case 33: The modification steps from SS to S′S′ is as follow:
11-st step: wxyz→S=wxyzwxyz→S=wxyz
22-nd step: wxyz→S=xwyzwxyz→S=xwyz
33-rd step: xwyz→S=ywxzxwyz→S=ywxz
44-th step: ywxz→S=zxwyywxz→S=zxwy
