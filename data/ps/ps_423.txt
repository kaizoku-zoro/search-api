A string SS is called Chef's favourite if every substring chef in SS must have a substring code before it.
You are given a string SS of size NN that contains both code and chef as a substring. Please determine if SS is Chef's favourite.
Note: A substring is a continuous part of string which can be obtained by deleting some (may be none) character's from the beginning and some (may be none) character's from the end.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test contains an integer NN - the size of the string.
The second line of each test contains a string SS.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line AC if SS is Chef's favourite, or WA otherwise.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤N≤1041≤N≤104
|S|=N|S|=N
SS consists only of lowercase English characters
Both code and chef appear as a substring at least once in SS
