Shlok and Sachin are good friends. Shlok wanted to test Sachin, so he wrote down a string SS with length NN and one character XX. He wants Sachin to find the number of different substrings of SS which contain the character XX at least once. Sachin is busy with his girlfriend, so he needs you to find the answer.
Two substrings of SS are considered different if their positions in SS are different.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN. 
The second line contains a string SS with length NN, followed by a space and a character XX.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of substrings of SS that contain XX.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,0001≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤1061≤N≤106
SS contains only lowercase English letters
XX is a lowercase English letter
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 103103
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints
