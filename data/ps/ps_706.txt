JJ loves playing with averages. He has an array AA of length NN. He wants to divide the array AA into two non-empty subsets PP and QQ such that the value of mean(P)+mean(Q)mean(P)+mean(Q) is as large as possible. (Note that each AiAi must belong to either subset PP or subset QQ).
Help him find this maximum value of mean(P)+mean(Q)mean(P)+mean(Q).
As a reminder, the mean of a subset XX of size MM is defined as: mean(X)=∑Mi=1XiMmean(X)=∑i=1MXiM. 
For example, mean([3,1,4,5])=3+1+4+54=3.25mean([3,1,4,5])=3+1+4+54=3.25.
Input Format

The first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN - the size of the array AA.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN denoting the array AA.

Output Format
Output the largest value of mean(P)+mean(Q)mean(P)+mean(Q).
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−610−6.
Formally, let your answer be aa, and the jury's answer be bb. Your answer is accepted if and only if |a−b|max(1,|b|)≤10−6|a−b|max(1,|b|)≤10−6.

Explanation
Test case-1: We can divide the two elements into two non-empty subsets PP and QQ as follows: P=[4]P=[4], Q=[5]Q=[5]. 
Therefore, mean(P)+mean(Q)=9mean(P)+mean(Q)=9.
Test case-2: In whatever way we divide the elements of the array, mean of both the subsets will always be 22.
Therefore, mean(P)+mean(Q)=4mean(P)+mean(Q)=4.
