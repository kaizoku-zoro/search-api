You are given two integers LL and RR. Find the smallest non-negative integer NN such that
N%L>N%(L+1)>…>N%(R−1)>N%R.N%L>N%(L+1)>…>N%(R−1)>N%R.
Here, %% is the modulo operator, so A%BA%B is the remainder of AA after division by BB. For example, 11%3=211%3=2.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest possible NN, or −1−1 if no solution exists.
It is guaranteed that when a solution exists, the smallest solution does not exceed 10181018.

Explanation
Example case 1: N=6N=6 satisfies the given condition, since 6%4(=2)>6%5(=1)>6%6(=0)6%4(=2)>6%5(=1)>6%6(=0). Notice that N=7N=7 also satisfies the condition, but it is larger.
Example case 2: It is impossible to find a valid solution because for any non-negative integer NN, we have N%1(=0)≤N%2N%1(=0)≤N%2.
