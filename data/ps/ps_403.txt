Finally a monsoon has come. According to the Meteorological Department, there will be rain in the upcoming NN days in the city. Initially, the water level of the city is zero millimetres. The amount of rain on the ii-th day can be described by an integer AiAi as follows:

If Ai>0Ai>0, the water level of the city increases by AiAi millimetres on the ii-th day.
If Ai=0Ai=0, there is no rain on the ii-th day. The water level of the city decreases by DD millimetres on such a day. However, if the water level is less than DD millimetres before the ii-th day, then it becomes zero instead.

There will be a red alert in the city if the water level becomes strictly greater than HH millimetres on at least one of the NN days. Determine if there will be a red alert.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, DD and HH.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if there will be a red alert or "NO" otherwise.

Explanation
Example case 1:

On the first day, the water level of the city increases to 11 millimtre.
On the second day, the water level increases by 33 millimeters and becomes 1+3=41+3=4 millimtres.
On the third day, there is no rain in the city, so the water level decreases by D=2D=2 millimtres and becomes 4−2=24−2=2 millimtres.
On the fourth day, the water level increases by 22 millimtres and becomes 2+2=42+2=4 millimtres.

There will be no red alert in the city because the water level does not exceed H=6H=6 millimtres on any of the four days.
Example case 2: The water level of the city on the 22-nd day is equal to 101101 millimtres, which is greater than H=100H=100 millimtres, so there will be a red alert in the city.
Example case 3: The water levels of the city on the four days are [1,3,1,3][1,3,1,3]. The water level is equal to H=3H=3 millimtres on the second and fourth day, but it does not exceed the threshold.
Example case 4: There will be a red alert in the city on the 33-rd day.
