You are an administrator of a popular quiz website. Every day, you hold a quiz on the website.
There are NN users (numbered 11 through NN) and MM admins (numbered N+1N+1 through N+MN+M). For each quiz, each user is allowed to attempt it at most once. Sometimes, admins attempt the quizzes for testing purposes too; an admin may attempt a quiz any number of times.
On a certain day, the quiz was attempted KK times. For each ii (1≤i≤K1≤i≤K), the ii-th of these attempts was made by the person with number LiLi. Find all the users who attempted the quiz more than once, in order to disqualify them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.
The second line contains KK space-separated integers L1,L2,…,LKL1,L2,…,LK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing an integer DD denoting the number of users who should be disqualified, followed by a space and DD space-separated integers denoting their numbers in ascending order.

Explanation
Example case 1: Since there is only a single attempt during the whole day, there cannot be any user who made more than one attempt.
Example case 2: User 11 attempted the quiz twice.
Example case 3: Users 22 and 55 attempted the quiz multiple times. The admin with number 1010 also attempted the quiz multiple times, but admins are allowed to do that.
