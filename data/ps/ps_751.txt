Chef received a new sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. He does not like arbitrarily ordered sequences, so he wants to permute the elements of AA in such a way that it would satisfy the following condition: there is an integer pp (1≤p≤N1≤p≤N) such that the first pp elements of the new (permuted) sequence are strictly increasing and the last N−p+1N−p+1 elements are strictly decreasing.
Help Chef and find a permutation of the given sequence which satisfies this condition or determine that no such permutation exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no permutation of AA that satisfies the given condition, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes).
The second line should contain NN space-separated integers ― the elements of your permuted sequence.
