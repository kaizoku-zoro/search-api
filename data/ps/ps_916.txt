Doraemon has a matrix with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and MM columns (numbered 11 through MM). Let's denote the element in row ii and column jj by Ai,jAi,j. Next, let's define a sub-row of a row rr as a sequence Ar,x,Ar,x+1,…,Ar,yAr,x,Ar,x+1,…,Ar,y for some xx and yy (1≤x≤y≤M1≤x≤y≤M) and a sub-column of a column cc by Ax,c,Ax+1,c,…,Ay,cAx,c,Ax+1,c,…,Ay,c for some xx and yy (1≤x≤y≤N1≤x≤y≤N).
You need to find the number of pairs (sub-row of some row, sub-column of some column) with the following properties:

Both sequences (the sub-row and the sub-column) have the same length.
This length is odd.
The central elements of both sequences are the same (they correspond to the same element of the matrix).
Both sequences are palindromes.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM. 
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains MM space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,MAi,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,M.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.

Explanation
Example case 1: Each element forms a valid pair (where the sub-row and sub-column contain only this element) and the middle row and middle column also form one valid pair.
