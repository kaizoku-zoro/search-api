Sarthak and Anuradha are very good friends and are eager to participate in an event called Equinox. It is a game of words. In this game, NN strings S1,…,SNS1,…,SN are given. For each string SiSi, if it starts with one of the letters of the word “EQUINOX”, Sarthak gets AA points and if not, Anuradha gets BB points. The one who has more points at the end of the game wins. If they both the same number of points, the game is a draw..
Print the winner of the game, if any, otherwise print “DRAW”.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains three integers NN, AA, BB.
NN lines follow, each containing a string SiSi.
All strings are in UPPERCASE.

Output

For each test case, print “SARTHAK” (case insensitive) if he has more points than Anuradha, print “ANURADHA” (case insensitive) if she has more points than Sarthak, otherwise print “DRAW” (case insensitive), without the quotes.

DRAW
ANURADHA


Explanation
Test case 11: The strings which start with one of the letters of the word EQUINOX are {{ EARTH, INDIA, UUUFFFDDD }}. Thus, Sarthak gets 11 point for each of these strings. In total, Sarthak gets 33 points.
On the other hand, there is one string that does not start with one of the letters of the word EQUINOX. Thus, Anuradha gets 33 points for that string.
Finally, since both of them have equal points, the game results in DRAW.
Test case 22: There is only one string that starts with one of the letters of the word EQUINOX which is XOXOXOXO. Thus, Sarthak gets 55 point for this string.
There is one string that does not start with one of the letters of the word EQUINOX. Thus, Anuradha gets 77 points for that string.
Finally, Anuradha has the higher score. So she is the winner.
