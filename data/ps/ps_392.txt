Chef has an array AA having NN elements. Chef wants to make all the elements of the array equal by repeating the following move.

Choose any integer KK between 11 and NN (inclusive). Then choose KK distinct indices i1,i2,…,iKi1,i2,…,iK, and increase the values of Ai1,Ai2,…,AiKAi1,Ai2,…,AiK by 11.

Find the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal. 
Input Format

The first line contains TT denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of elements in AA.
The second line of each test case contains NN space separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal. 
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤1051≤Ai≤105
The sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105.

Explanation

Test Case 11: In the first move, Chef can choose K=2K=2, and choose the indices {1,3}{1,3}. After increasing A1A1 and A3A3 by 11, the array will become [2,3,2][2,3,2].
In the second move, Chef can choose K=2K=2, and choose the indices {1,3}{1,3}. After increasing A1A1 and A3A3 by 11, the array will become [3,3,3][3,3,3], and hence all the elements become equal. 
Test Case 22: All the elements of the array are equal, hence no move is required.
