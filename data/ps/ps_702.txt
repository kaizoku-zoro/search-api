Recently, Greg got a grid with n rows and m columns. Rows are indexed from 1 to n and columns are indexed from 1 to m. The cell (i,j)(i,j) is the cell of intersection of row i and column j. Each cell has a number written on it. The number written on cell  (i,j)(i,j)  is equal to  (i+j)(i+j).  
Now, Greg wants to select some cells from the grid, such that for every pair of  selected cells ,the numbers on the cells are co-prime.  Determine the maximum number of cells that Greg can select.
Input 
Single line containing  integers n and m denoting number of rows and number of columns respectively.
Output
Single line containing the answer.

Constraints
