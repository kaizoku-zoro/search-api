Ved started playing a new mobile game called Fighting Clans. An army of NN enemies is approaching his base. The ithith enemy has HiHi health points. An enemy gets killed if his health points become 00.
Ved defends his base using a weapon named Inferno. He can set the Inferno to one of the following two modes:

Single-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target exactly one living enemy and cause damage of at most XX health points.
Multi-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target all living enemies and cause damage of 11 health point to each of them.

Find the minimum time required to kill all the enemies.
Note: Ved is not allowed to change the mode of the weapon once it is set initially.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers NN and XX - the number of enemies and the damage caused by the single-target mode of Inferno in one second respectively.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers H1,H2,…,HNH1,H2,…,HN where HiHi denotes the initial health points of ithith enemy.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to kill all the enemies.

Explanation
Test case 1: In single-target mode, all enemies can be killed in 11 second each. Thus, in single-target mode, the total time required is 55 seconds.
In multi-target mode:

After one second, the health points of the enemies are: [1,1,3,0,0][1,1,3,0,0]. Enemies 44 and 55 are dead after one second.
After two seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,2,0,0][0,0,2,0,0].
After three seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,1,0,0][0,0,1,0,0].
After four seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0,0].

Thus, 44 seconds are required to kill enemies using multi-target mode. The minimum time required to kill all the enemies is 44 seconds.
Test case 2: In single-target mode, all enemies can be killed in 11 second each. Thus, in single-target mode, the total time required is 33 seconds.
In multi-target mode:

After one second, the health points of the enemies are: [4,3,4][4,3,4].
After two seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [3,2,3][3,2,3].
After three seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [2,1,2][2,1,2].
After four seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [1,0,1][1,0,1].
After five seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,0][0,0,0].

Thus, 55 seconds are required to kill enemies using multi-target mode. The minimum time required to kill all the enemies is 33 seconds.
Test case 3: Here, single-target mode will take 44 seconds and multi-target mode will also take 44 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time required is 44 seconds.
Test case 4: Here, single-target mode will take 33 seconds, while multi-target mode will take 99 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time required is 33 seconds.
