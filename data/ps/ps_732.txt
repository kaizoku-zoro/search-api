"The secret impresses no one, the trick you use it for is everything." - The Prestige
This is an interactive problem.
An NN-perfect number is defined as a positive integer with at most NN digits (in decimal representation without leading zeros) ― that is, XX is an NN-perfect number if 0<X<10N0<X<10N.
Chef has a friend named Dynamo, who is a legendary magician. Chef learned a new magic trick from him and now, he wants to impress his friend Cheffa by showing her the trick:

First, Cheffa should choose a positive integer NN and tell it to Chef.
Then, Cheffa should choose an NN-perfect number AA and tell it to Chef, who should then choose a positive integer SS and tell it to Cheffa.
Then, Cheffa and Chef should alternately tell each other four NN-perfect numbers BB, CC, DD and EE (in this order). Cheffa chooses BB and DD, while Chef chooses CC and EE.
Cheffa will be really impressed if SS turns out to be equal to A+B+C+D+EA+B+C+D+E. Otherwise, Cheffa will be angry that Chef was wasting her time with a failed magic trick.

Since Chef is busy in the kitchen, you should perform the magic trick for him and impress Cheffa. The grader is acting as Cheffa and it is trying to make the magic trick fail.
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer TT. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer NN. Then, you should perform the following actions:
Read a line containing a single integer AA.
Print a line containing a single integer SS.
Read a line containing a single integer BB.
Print a line containing a single integer CC.
Read a line containing a single integer DD.
Print a line containing a single integer EE.
Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: 11 if your predicted sum SS is correct or −1−1 if it is incorrect.

Note that when you receive −1−1 at the end of a test case, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Example
You             Grader
                1
                2
                10
50
                10
12
                10
8
                1

Explanation
Example case 1: The sum of A=10A=10, B=10B=10, C=12C=12, D=10D=10 and E=8E=8 is 5050, which is the same as the predicted sum.
Note that this example is just supposed to clarify the interaction. The grader will not be as friendly.
