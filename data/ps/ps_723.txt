Given a positive integer nn and an integer kk such that 0≤k≤n0≤k≤n, find any permutation AA of 1,2…n1,2…n such that the number of indices for which Ai=iAi=i is exactly kk. If there exists no such permutation, print −1−1. If there exist multiple such permutations, print any one of them.
Input Format

First line of the input contains TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers n,kn,k.

Output Format
For each test case, print a permutation in a single line, if a permutation with the given constraints exists. Print −1−1 otherwise.

1≤n≤1051≤n≤105
0≤k≤n0≤k≤n
Sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅1062⋅106

Explanation
Test case 11: There are total 22 permutations of [1,2][1,2]  which are [1,2][1,2] and [2,1][2,1]. There are 22 indices in [1,2][1,2] and 00 indices in [2,1][2,1] for which Ai=iAi=i holds true. Thus, there doesn't exist any permutation of [1,2][1,2] with exactly 11 index ii for which Ai=iAi=i holds true.
Test case 22: Consider the permutation A=[1,3,2]A=[1,3,2]. We have A1=1A1=1, A2=3A2=3 and A3=2A3=2. So, this permutation has exactly 11 index such that Ai=iAi=i.
