Given an integer NN, help Chef in finding an NN-digit odd positive integerodd positive integer XX such that XX is divisible by 33 but not by 99.
Note:Note: There should not be any leading zeroes in XX. In other words, 003003 is not a valid 33-digit odd positive integer.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the TT testcases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN, denoting the number of digits in XX.

Output Format
For each testcase, output a single line containing an NN-digit odd positive integer XX in decimal number system, such that XX is divisible by 33 but not by 99.
Constraints

1≤T≤5001≤T≤500
1≤N≤1041≤N≤104
The sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105

Explanation
Test Case 11: 33 is the only 11-digit odd positive integer which is divisible by 33 but not by 99.
Test Case 22: 1515 is a 22-digit odd positive integer which is divisible by 33 but not by 99. 2121 is also a valid answer, among others. Note that 0303 is not a valid answer as there should not be any leading zeroes in the output.
