Read problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are three friends; let's call them A, B, C. They made the following statements:

A: "I have xx Rupees more than B."
B: "I have yy rupees more than C."
C: "I have zz rupees more than A."

You do not know the exact values of x,y,zx,y,z. Instead, you are given their absolute values, i.e. X=|x|X=|x|, Y=|y|Y=|y| and Z=|z|Z=|z|. Note that xx, yy, zz may be negative; "having −r−r rupees more" is the same as "having rr rupees less".
Find out if there is some way to assign amounts of money to A, B, C such that all of their statements are true.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers XX, YY and ZZ.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if the presented scenario is possible or "no" otherwise (without quotes).

yes
no


Explanation
Example 1: One possible way to satisfy all conditions is: A has 1010 rupees, B has 99 rupees and C has 1111 rupees. Therefore, we have x=1x=1, y=−2y=−2, z=1z=1.
Example 2: There is no way for all conditions to be satisfied.
