You are given two sequences AA and BB, each with size MM, and an integer NN. Consider the following pseudocode:
result := 0
for i := 1 to M
    for j := 1 to M
        array fib[1..max(2, N)]
        fib[1] := A[i]
        fib[2] := B[j]
        for k := 3 to N
            fib[k] := fib[k-1] + fib[k-2]
        result := result + fib[N]

Compute the final value of the variable result. Since it can be very large, compute its remainder modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-seperated integers MM and NN.
The second line contains MM space-seperated integers A1,A2,…,AMA1,A2,…,AM.
The third line contains MM space-seperated integers B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM.

Output
For each test case, print the final value of result modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Example case 1: The innermost loop is ran for 9 pairs of initial values: (1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6). The corresponding values added to result are 
5,6,7,6,7,8,7,8,95,6,7,6,7,8,7,8,9, and their sum is 63.
