Given an array AA of length NN, we can define rotation as follows. If we rotate AA to the right, all elements move to the right one unit, and the last element moves to the beginning. That is, it becomes [AN,A1,A2,…,AN−1][AN,A1,A2,…,AN−1]. Similarly if we rotate AA to the left, it becomes [A2,A3,…,AN,A1][A2,A3,…,AN,A1].
Given an array AA and an integer xx, define f(A,x)f(A,x) to be the array AA rotated by the amount xx. If x≥0x≥0, this means we rotate it right xx times. If x<0x<0, this means we rotate it left |x||x| times.
You are given an array AA of length NN. Then QQ queries follow. In each query, an integer xx is given. To answer the query, you should replace AA with A+f(A,x)A+f(A,x) where ++ denotes concatenation. After this operation, you must output the sum of all elements of AA. Since this number can be large, output it modulo 109+7109+7.
Note that the queries are cumulative. When you modify AA to answer one query, it starts that way for the next query.
Input

The first line contains an integer NN - the size of the initial array. 
The second line contains NN integers A1,…,ANA1,…,AN - the elements of the initial array.
The third line contains an integer QQ - the number of queries.
The fourth line contains QQ space-separated integers x1,…,xQx1,…,xQ, where xixi is the parameter of the ii-th query.

Output
After each query, output in a single line the the sum of all elements of the current array modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Initially, the array is [1,2][1,2].
After the first query, the array becomes [1,2]+f([1,2],1)=[1,2]+[2,1]=[1,2,2,1][1,2]+f([1,2],1)=[1,2]+[2,1]=[1,2,2,1]. The total sum is 66.
After the second query, the array becomes [1,2,2,1]+f([1,2,2,1],1)=[1,2,2,1]+[1,1,2,2]=[1,2,2,1,1,1,2,2][1,2,2,1]+f([1,2,2,1],1)=[1,2,2,1]+[1,1,2,2]=[1,2,2,1,1,1,2,2]. The total sum is 1212.
