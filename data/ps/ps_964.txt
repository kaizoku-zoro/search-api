Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You are given two positive integers – A and B. You have to check whether A is divisible by all the prime divisors of B.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
For each test case, you are given two space separated integers – A and B.
Output
For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if A contains all prime divisors of B, otherwise print "No".
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 104
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1018

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (20 points):1 ≤ B ≤ 107
Subtask 2 (30 points):1 ≤ A ≤ 107
Subtask 3 (50 points): Original constraints


                        Sample Input 1
                        





3
120 75
128 16
7 8



                        Sample Output 1
                        





Yes
Yes
No


Explanation
Example case 1. In the first case 120 = 23*3*5 and 75 = 3*52. 120 is divisible by both 3 and 5. Hence, we will print "Yes"
Example case 2. In the second case both 128 and 16 are powers of two. Hence, the answer is "Yes"
Example case 3. In the third case 8 is power of two and 7 is not divisible by 2. So, the answer is "No"
