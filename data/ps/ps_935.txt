An index ii in a permutation PP of length NN is said to be good if:

PiPi is divisible by ii

You are given 22 integers NN and KK. You need to construct a permutation PP of length NN such that exactly KK indices in that permutation are good.
If no such permutation exists, output −1−1.
If multiple such permutations exist, output any.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers NN and KK - the length of the permutation to be constructed and the number of good indices.

Output Format
For each test case, output any permutation satisfying the given condition.

Explanation
Test case-1: In [1][1], P1=1P1=1 is divisible by 11. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 11 good index.
Test case-2: In [4,5,6,1,2,3][4,5,6,1,2,3], P1=4P1=4 is divisible by 11 and P3=6P3=6 is divisible by 33. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 22 good indices.
