There are KK problems in a contest with NN participants. All the problems don't necessarily have the same points assigned to them - you are given an array AA of integers, where AiAi denotes the points assigned to the ithith problem. If a participant solves the ithith problem, they will get AiAi points added to their total score. Note that there are no partial points - they can get only 00 or AiAi points on the ithith problem. For each participant ii, you are also given their final verdict in each problem in the form of a binary string SiSi - a 11 denotes that they solved that problem, and a 00 denotes that they did not. 
Your job is to find the total score of each participant.
Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains 22 space separated integers, NN and KK, denoting the number of participants and the number of problems in the contest respectively.
The second line contains KK space separated integers - A1,A2,…,AKA1,A2,…,AK, where AiAi denotes the points assigned to the ithith  problem.
The ithith of the next NN lines contains a binary string SiSi of length KK, where SijSij represents the verdict of the jthjth problem for ithith participant. Sij=1Sij=1 if they solved that problem, and Sij=0Sij=0 otherwise.

Output:
For each testcase, output NN lines, with the ithith line containing a single integer denoting the total score of the ithith participant.

Explanation
Case 1: The first participant's binary string is "0101", which means that they did not solve the first problem, but they solved the second problem. And as the points assigned to the two problems are 11 and 22, the total score of the first participant is 22. Hence the first output is 22.
Similarly, the second participant's binary string is "1010", which means that they solved the first problem, but did not solve the second problem. So their total score is 11. Hence the second output is 11.
Case 2: The first participant's binary string is "1111", which means that they solved both the first and second problems. And as the points assigned to the two problems are 11 and 22, the total score of the first participant is 1+2=31+2=3. Hence the third output is 33.
Similarly, the second participant's binary string is "0000", which means that they did not solve any problem. So their total score is 00. And hence the fourth output is 00.
Case 3: The first participant's binary string is "00", which means that they did not solve the only problem of the contest. Hence the total score of the first participant is 00. Hence the fifth output is 00.
Similarly, the second participant's binary string is "11", which means that they solved the only problem in the contest. And as the points assigned to that problem is 100100, the total score of the second participant is 100100. Hence the last output is 100100.
