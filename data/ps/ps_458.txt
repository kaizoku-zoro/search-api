Johnny needs to make a rectangular box for his physics class project. He has bought P cm of wire and S cm2 of special paper. He would like to use all the wire (for the 12 edges) and paper (for the 6 sides) to make the box.
What is the largest volume of the box that Johnny can make?
Input
The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.

Each test case contains two integers P and S in a line (1 ≤ P ≤ 40000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 20000). You may assume that there always exists an optimal solution for the given input cases.

Output
For each test case, print a real number that is the largest volume of the box that Johnny can make, rounded to two decimal places.

                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
20 14
20 16



                        Sample Output 1
                        





3.00
4.15


Explanation
First case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 3, 1 and 1.
Second case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 7/3, 4/3 and 4/3.
