The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:

The MEX of [2,2,1][2,2,1] is 00, because 00 does not belong to the array.
The MEX of [3,1,0,1][3,1,0,1] is 22, because 00 and 11 belong to the array, but 22 does not.
The MEX of [0,3,1,2][0,3,1,2] is 4 because 0,1,20,1,2 and 33 belong to the array, but 44 does not.

Find the maximum possible MEX of an array of non-negative integers such that the bitwise OR of the elements in the array does not exceed XX.
Input Format

The first line contains TT denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer XX on a single line.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the maximum possible MEX of the array satisfying the given property.

Explanation
Test case 11: The array could be [0][0]. 
Test case 22: The array could be [0,1][0,1]. Here the bitwise OR of 00 and 11 is 11 and the MEX of the array is 22 as both 00 and 11 belongs to the array.
Test case 44: The array could be [1,0,3,2][1,0,3,2]. Here the bitwise OR of all integers in the array is 33 and the MEX of the array is 44.
