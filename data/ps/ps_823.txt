"It's totally fun to play troublemakers ― totally." - Lee Pace
Sakshi had a matrix with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and MM columns (numbered 11 through MM). Initially, all cells of this matrix contained 00-s. Let's denote a cell in row rr and column cc by (r,c)(r,c).
Sakshi is well-known for troubling others. This time, her friends Nikki and Mansi planned to take revenge and teach her a lesson, so they changed her matrix by performing the following operation QQ times:

Choose any valid cell (x,y)(x,y).
Add 11 to all the cells in row xx.
Add 11 to all the cells in column yy.

For each valid ii, the cell chosen in the ii-th operation was (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi). Nikki and Mansi challenged Sakshi to find the number of cells in the resulting matrix which contain odd integers. Sakshi is not good at math, since she has spent all her life troubling others, so this time, she really needs your help. Help Sakshi find the answer.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and QQ.
QQ lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤Q1≤i≤Q), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiXi and YiYi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of cells with odd values.
