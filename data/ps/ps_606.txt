Vasya has ordered a pizza delivery. The pizza can be considered a perfect circle. There were nn premade cuts in the pizza when it was delivered. Each cut is a straight segment connecting the center of the pizza with its boundary.
Let OO be the center of the pizza, PiPi be the endpoint of the ii-th cut lying on the boundary, and RR be the point of the boundary straight to the right of OO. Then the counterclockwise-measured angle ∠ROPi∠ROPi is equal to aiai degrees, where aiai is an integer between 00 and 359359. Note that angles between 00 and 180180 angles correspond to PiPi in the top half of the pizza, while angles between 180180 and 360360 angles correspond to the bottom half.
Vasya may cut his pizza a few more times, and the new cuts still have to be straight segments starting at the center. He wants to make the pizza separated into several equal slices, with each slice being a circular sector with no cuts inside of it. How many new cuts Vasya will have to make?
Input:
The first line of input contains TT , i.e number of test cases per file.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n−n−  the numbers of premade cuts (2≤n≤3602≤n≤360).
The second lines contains nn integers a1,…,an−a1,…,an− angles of the cuts 1,…,n1,…,n respectively (0≤a1<…,an−1<3600≤a1<…,an−1<360).
Output:
Print a single integer−− the smallest number of additional cuts Vasya has to make so that the pizza is divided into several equal slices.

Explanation
In the first sample the pizza is already cut into four equal slices.
In the second sample the pizza will be cut into three equal slices after making one extra cut at 330330 degrees.
In the third sample Vasya will have to cut his pizza into 360360 pieces of 11 degree angle each.
