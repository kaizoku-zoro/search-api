An array is called lovely if the sum of product of each adjacent pair of elements is odd.
More formally, the array SS of size MM is lovely if the value ∑M−1i=1∑i=1M−1 (Si.Si+1)(Si.Si+1) is odd.
You are given an array AA consisting of NN positive integers. Find a permutation of array AA which is lovely. 
If multiple such permutations are possible, output any. If there is no lovely permutation, output -1.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, if a lovely permutation of AA is possible, print a single line containing NN integers denoting the elements of any lovely permutation of AA. Otherwise, print -1.

Explanation
Test Case 11: The sum of products of adjacent pair of elements of the given array is 1⋅2+2⋅3+3⋅4+4⋅10=2+6+12+40=601⋅2+2⋅3+3⋅4+4⋅10=2+6+12+40=60. Since this value is even, this is not a lovely permutation of the array.
A lovely permutation of the given array is [3,1,10,2,4][3,1,10,2,4]. The sum of products for this array would be 3⋅1+1⋅10+10⋅2+2⋅4=413⋅1+1⋅10+10⋅2+2⋅4=41, which is odd.
Test Case 22: No permutation of the given array exists where the sum of products of adjacent pair of elements is odd. Thus, answer is −1−1.
