Chef is stuck at the following problem. Help him solve it!
Chef has a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. He should find the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N1≤i<j≤N and the bitwise XOR of AiAi and AjAj can be written as a sum of two (not necessarily different) prime numbers with the same parity (both odd or both even).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN. 
The second line contains NN space-seprated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid pairs.

Explanation
Example case 1: The three valid pairs are (1,2)(1,2), (1,3)(1,3) and (2,3)(2,3). For example, A1⊕A2=2⊕4=6=3+3A1⊕A2=2⊕4=6=3+3.
