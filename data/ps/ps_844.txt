Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a range of positive integers L,L+1,…RL,L+1,…R. Find an integer XX greater than 11 which is coprime with all the integers in this range (does not share any common factors greater than 11 with any of these integers). In addition, XX must not exceed 2⋅1092⋅109.
If there are multiple solutions satisfying these conditions, you may find any one of them. It is guaranteed that for the given constraints, at least one such integer XX exists.
For example, if L=16L=16 and R=17R=17, then X=9X=9 is coprime with both 1616 and 1717. However, if L=6L=6 and R=12R=12 instead, then X=9X=9 shares a common factor 33 with 66 and 1212 and a common factor 99 with 99.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer XX which satisfies the above conditions.
