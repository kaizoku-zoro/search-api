Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared pp different sets of questions (numbered 00 through p−1p−1), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:

The students are assigned roll numbers — pairwise distinct positive integers.
If a student's roll number is rr, this student gets the ((r−1)%p)((r−1)%p)-th set of questions.

Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: AA and BB respectively. Find the number of values of pp for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers AA and BB.

Output
For each test case, print a single line — the number of values of pp for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or −1−1 if there is an infinite number of such values.
