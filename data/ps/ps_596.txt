Chef is studying computer science. Tomorrow, he has an exam on algorithms and data structures. One of the algorithms he is required to study is the Hungarian algorithm (you do not have to know this algorithm to solve this problem).
In the Hungarian algorithm, you start with a matrix of positive integers with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and NN columns (numbered 11 through NN). The algorithm proceeds in steps.
In the first step, for each row of the matrix, you should find the smallest element in this row (let's denote it by AA) and subtract AA from each element of the matrix in this row.
In the second step, for each column of the matrix, you should find the smallest element in this column (let's denote it by AA) and subtract AA from each element in this column. The remaining steps of the algorithm are not relevant in this problem.
Currently, Chef is practicing implementation of the first two steps of the algorithm. He wants you to check if he is doing these two steps correctly or not. You are given a matrix with NN rows and NN columns; let's denote the element of this matrix in the ii-th row and jj-th column by ai,jai,j. Determine if this matrix can be the result of applying the first two steps of the Hungarian algorithm on some matrix.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of the following NN lines contains NN space-separated integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,Nai,1,ai,2,…,ai,N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" (without quotes) if the given matrix can be a result of the first two steps or "NO" (without quotes) if it cannot.

Explanation
Example case 1: Let's consider the matrix
3 1 5
7 2 3
5 4 3

and apply the first two steps of the Hungarian algorithm on it.
In the first step:

the smallest integer in row 11 is 11
the smallest integer in row 22 is 22
the smallest integer in row 33 is 33

After subtracting, the matrix becomes
2 0 4
5 0 1
2 1 0

and the second step is performed on this matrix. In the second step:

the smallest integer in column 11 is 22
the smallest integer in column 22 is 00
the smallest integer in column 33 is 00

After subtracting, the resulting matrix is
0 0 4
3 0 1
0 1 0

and this is the matrix given on the input, so the answer is YES.
Example case 2: It is impossible to find a matrix such that after applying the first two steps of the Hungarian algorithm, it becomes the matrix given on the input, so the answer is NO.
