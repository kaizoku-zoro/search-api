Given two positive numbers BB and CC, what is the minimum positive value of AA, such that A⋅BA⋅B is divisible by CC.
Here, A⋅BA⋅B denotes the value obtained when AA is multiplied by BB. 
Input Format

The first line will contain an integer TT - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers BB and CC.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum value of AA such that A⋅BA⋅B is divisible by CC.

Explanation
Test case 11: We have B=2B=2 and C=4C=4. If we choose A=2A=2, then A⋅B=4A⋅B=4, which is divisible by 44. Note that this is minimum positive value of AA, such that A⋅BA⋅B is divisible by CC.
Test case 22: We have B=8B=8 and C=12C=12. If we choose A=3A=3, then A⋅B=24A⋅B=24, which is divisible by 1212. Note that this is minimum positive value of AA, such that A⋅BA⋅B is divisible by CC.
