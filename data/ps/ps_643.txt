Given a positive integer NN, find an array A=[A1,A2,…,AN]A=[A1,A2,…,AN] of length NN consisting of distinct integers from 11 to 109109, such that the following condition is satisfied for each subarray [AL,AL+1,…,Ar][AL,AL+1,…,Ar] (1≤L≤R≤N1≤L≤R≤N):

The sum of elements in the subarray is divisible by its length i.e. AL+AL+1+…+ARAL+AL+1+…+AR is divisible by R−L+1R−L+1.

It can be proved that such an array always exists under given constraints.
If there are multiple possible arrays, you may print any of them.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one positive integer NN, the length of the array AA.

Output Format
For each test case, print one line containing NN space-separated integers, the contents of the array AA.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤10001≤N≤1000
Sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 50005000

Test case 22:
For array A=[1,3]A=[1,3],

The sum of elements of the subarray [1][1] is equal to 11 which is divisible by 11, the length of this subarray.
The sum of elements of the subarray [3][3] is equal to 33 which is divisible by 11, the length of this subarray.
The sum of elements of the subarray [1,3][1,3] is equal to 44 which is divisible by 22, the length of this subarray.

Test case 33:
For array A=[4,2,6]A=[4,2,6],

The sum of elements of the subarray [4][4] is equal to 44 which is divisible by 11, the length of this subarray.
The sum of elements of the subarray [2][2] is equal to 22 which is divisible by 11, the length of this subarray.
The sum of elements of the subarray [6][6] is equal to 66 which is divisible by 11, the length of this subarray.
The sum of elements of the subarray [4,2][4,2] is equal to 66 which is divisible by 22, the length of this subarray.
