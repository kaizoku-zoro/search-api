Explanation
Denoting Meliodas as MM, Ban as BB.
Testcase 1:
MM=5, BB=3
Ban eates 3 chocolates of Meliodas.
MM=2, BB=3
Meliodas eats 2 chocolates of Ban.
MM=2, BB=1
Ban eates 1 chocolate of Meliodas.
MM=1, BB=1
Since they have the same no of candies, they stop quarreling.
Total candies left: 2  
Testcase 2:
MM=10, BB=10
Since both of them had the same candies to begin with, there was no point in fighting.
Total candies left: 20  
Testcase 3:
MM=4, BB=8
Meliodas eats 4 chocolates of Ban.
MM=4, BB=4
Since they have the same no of candies, they stop quarreling.
Total candies left: 8
