Chef is given a binary string SS of length NN. As Chef loves 10101010 and he is busy in the preparation of Christmas, he asks you to count the maximum number of continuous substrings 10101010, which Chef can get after reordering symbols in the given string.
As a reminder, a binary string is a string consisting only of 00's ans 11's.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of the test case contains an integer NN - the length of the binary string.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string SS.

Output Format
For each test case, print maximum number of continuous substrings 10101010, which Chef can get after reordering symbols in the string.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
2≤N≤1002≤N≤100

Explanation

Test case 11: There are no 00s in the string, so a 10101010 substring is not possible.
Test case 22: We can reorder string into 0101010001010100, in which the first 10101010 starts from index 22, and the second 10101010 starts from index 44. It can be proven that there are no orderings that give the answer larger than 22.
