A binary string is called a self-destructing string if it can reduced to an empty string by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero): Choose a valid integer ii such that the ii-th character of the current string is different from the i+1i+1-th character, and remove these two characters from the string.
You are given a binary string ss. Your task is to convert ss to a self-destructing string. To do that, you may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose an integer ii (1≤i≤|s|−11≤i≤|s|−1) such that the ii-th character of ss is different from the i+1i+1-th character, and invert one of these characters (inverting a character means changing '0' to '1' or '1' to '0', e.g. the string "01" can be changed to "00").
Find the smallest number of operations required to convert ss to a self-destructing string or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string ss.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest required number of operations or −1−1 if it is impossible to convert ss to a self-destructing string.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,0001≤T≤1,000
1≤|s|≤1061≤|s|≤106
ss contains only characters '0' and '1'
the sum of |s||s| over all test cases does not exceed 106106

Explanation
Example case 1: We already have a self-destructing string because "001101" can be converted to "0101", to "01" and finally to an empty string.
Example case 2: We can choose i=3i=3 (since s3≠s4s3≠s4) and then invert s4s4 to obtain "1100", which is a self-destructing string.
Example case 3: It can be shown that "110" cannot be converted to a self-destructing string.
