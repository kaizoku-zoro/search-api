Alice has a very complex machine ― when fed with a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, it produces a sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN, where for each valid ii, BiBi is the largest index jj such that AiAi divides AjAj (since AiAi divides itself, such an index always exist). For example, if the machine is fed with A=[2,6,5,3,4]A=[2,6,5,3,4], it produces B=[5,2,3,4,5]B=[5,2,3,4,5].
Alice gave you a sequence BB that was produced by the machine. Find an integer sequence AA such that when it is fed into the machine, then the machine produces the sequence BB. Alice does not like huge integers, so make sure that 1≤Ai≤4⋅1061≤Ai≤4⋅106 holds for each valid ii.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. For each valid ii, 1≤Ai≤4⋅1061≤Ai≤4⋅106 should hold.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.
