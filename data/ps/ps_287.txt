Frieza wants to become immortal. In order to do that he must acquire all the seven dragon balls. In a legendary fight, he is able to defeat Kami, the Guardian of the dragon balls. Now he has come across a case that contains the dragon balls and he needs your help to open it. 
The case requires a pin number to be unlocked. And the clever Kami has left a puzzle on the case which must be cracked to unlock the case.
On the case, is displayed a string, SS of length NN consisting of lowercase alphabets. To unlock, he needs to convert this string into a pin number RR. 
The trick to creating that pin lies in his name [f,r,i,e,z,a][f,r,i,e,z,a]. Every character in SS is either goodgood or badbad. It is goodgood, if it is a part of the letter set [f,r,i,e,z,a][f,r,i,e,z,a]. It is badbad otherwise. He'll have to traverse SS one by one and count consecutive letters that are goodgood or badbad and then store these corresponding counts in the same order in RR. Thus the pin number, RR will be a concatenation of the counts of these letters. See Sample Input for more details.
You have to help him find out RR.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows. 
Each test case contains a single string SS consisting of lowercase characters [a−z][a−z].

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line answer denoting the decoded string which Frieza can use to attain immortality.
Constraints

1≤T≤51≤T≤5
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
SS consists of only lower case alphabets.

Explanation
Example case 1: The string SS is "krillinisdead". The letter, "k" does not belong to the set [f,r,i,e,z,a][f,r,i,e,z,a] and hence it's count, i.e., 1 is appended to the string RR. "ri" belongs to the set [f,r,i,e,z,a][f,r,i,e,z,a] and hence 2 is appended to RR. "ll" doesn't belong to the set [f,r,i,e,z,a][f,r,i,e,z,a], so it's count 2 is appended to the string RR. The string RR keeps getting updated and the final answer is returned when the input string has been completely traversed.
