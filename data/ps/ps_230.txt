In order to establish dominance amongst his friends, Chef has decided that he will only walk in large steps of length exactly KK feet. However, this has presented many problems in Chef’s life because there are certain distances that he cannot traverse. Eg. If his step length is 55 feet, he cannot travel a distance of 1212 feet. Chef has a strict travel plan that he follows on most days, but now he is worried that some of those distances may become impossible to travel. Given NN distances, tell Chef which ones he cannot travel.
Input:

The first line will contain a single integer TT, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case will contain two space separated integers - NN, the number of distances, and KK, Chef’s step length.
The second line of each test case will contain NN space separated integers, the ithith of which represents DiDi, the distance of the ithith path.

Output:
For each testcase, output a string consisting of NN characters. The ithith character should be 11 if the distance is traversable, and 00 if not.
