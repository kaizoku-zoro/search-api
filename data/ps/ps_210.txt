As we know, Danny has a huge army and each time she wins a battle the size of her army is increased. Missandei, her advisor and Handmaiden, keeps the log of each battle and the amount and strength of soldiers won in a battle. 
Now, Danny has some questions for Missandei in which she asks the strength of the army gained during some battles. She will ask the query of the form L,RL,R and Missandei has to tell the strength gained in between the LL and RR battles. Help Missandei. 
You are given an array AA, where A[i]A[i] represents the number of soldiers won in ithith battle and the strength of a soldier who was won in ithith battle is given in another array B[i]B[i]. ( B[i]B[i] represents the strength of each soldier who was won in the ithith battle). 
Input:

First line will contain NN and QQ, number of battles fought and number of queries. 
Next line contains NN space separated integers denoting the array AA.
Next line contains NN space separated integers denoting the array BB.
Next QQ lines contain two integers LL and RR.

Output:
For each query, output the strength gained in between the LL and RR battles (both inclusive).
