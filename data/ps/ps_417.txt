Chef just had a big argument with his best friend. He is quite upset and doesn't want anything to remind him of his pal.
Chef has to construct a binary string SS of length NN. He would like it to be as far from a palindrome as possible, and so he would like SS to satisfy the following condition:

Let TT be the reverse of SS. Then, Si≠TiSi≠Ti for every 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N.

Can you help Chef construct SS?
If there are multiple possible strings that satisfy Chef's condition, you may print any of them.
Note 1: A string SS is said to be a binary string if every character of SS is either '0' or '1'.
Note 2: Let SS be a string of length NN. String TT is said to be its reverse if Ti=SN+1−iTi=SN+1−i for every 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N. For example, the reverse of 1001010010 is 0100101001 and the reverse of 01100110 is 01100110.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer NN — the length of the binary string Chef wants to construct.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing a binary string SS of length NN as described in the problem statement. If no such string exists, output −1−1 instead.
If multiple answers exist, you may print any of them.
Constraints

1≤T≤1031≤T≤103
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
The sum of NN across all test cases does not exceed 105105

Explanation
Test Case 11: It can be proven that there is no possible valid string SS. 
Test Case 22: S=10010110S=10010110 and T=01101001T=01101001. It is easy to see that for all 1≤i≤81≤i≤8, Si≠TiSi≠Ti.
