Nasir and two of his henchmen are planning to attack NN shops of the Qureshi clan. The shops are conveniently lined up, and numbered from 11 to NN. The ii-th shop contains AiAi kg of coal.
For a given subarray of shops [AL,AL+1,…,AR][AL,AL+1,…,AR], the bitwise and of this subarray is defined to be the bitwise AND of the coal contained in each of the shops, i.e, AL&AL+1&…&ARAL&AL+1&…&AR.
The damage caused when bombing the ii-th shop is computed to be the maximum bitwise and over all subarrays containing shop ii, and whose size is strictly larger than 1.
For each shop (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), find the damage caused when Nasir bombs it.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, denoting the number of shops.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers, the ii-th of which is AiAi, representing the amount of coal in the ii-th shop.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing NN integers d1,d2,…,dnd1,d2,…,dn where didi represents the maximum damage that can be caused if the ii-th shop is to be bombed.
Constraints

Explanation
Test case 1: There are several choices of subarray which give the maximum for each index. One such choice is given below:
For shop 11, choose subarray [29,412,671,255][29,412,671,255]
For shop 22, choose subarray [412,671,255][412,671,255]
For shop 33, choose subarray [671,255][671,255]
For shop 44. choose subarray [671,255][671,255]
For shop 55, choose subarray [412,671,255,912][412,671,255,912]
