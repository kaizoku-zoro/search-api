Coach Khaled is a swag teacher in HIT (Hag Institute of Technology). However, he has some obsession problems.
Recently, coach Khaled was teaching a course in building 8G networks using TV antennas and programming them with assembly. There are NN students (numbered 11 through NN) in his class; for some reason, this number is always a multiple of 44. The final exam has finished and Khaled has all the scores of his NN students. For each valid ii, the score of the ii-th student is AiAi; each score is an integer between 00 and 100100. Currently, the score-grade distribution is as follows:

grade D for score smaller than 6060
grade C for score greater or equal to 6060, but smaller than 7575
grade B for score greater or equal to 7575, but smaller than 9090
grade A for score greater or equal to 9090

However, coach Khaled is not satisfied with this. He wants exactly N/4N/4 students to receive each grade (A, B, C and D), so that the grades are perfectly balanced. The scores cannot be changed, but the boundaries between grades can. Therefore, he wants to choose three integers xx, yy and zz and change the grade distribution to the following (note that initially, x=60x=60, y=75y=75 and z=90z=90):

grade D for score smaller than xx
grade C for score greater or equal to xx, but smaller than yy
grade B for score greater or equal to yy, but smaller than zz
grade A for score greater or equal to zz

Your task is to find thresholds xx, yy and zz that result in a perfect balance of grades. If there are multiple solutions, choose the one with the maximum value of x+y+zx+y+z (because coach Khaled wants seem smarter than his students); it can be proved that there is at most one such solution. Sometimes, there is no way to choose the thresholds and coach Khaled would resign because his exam questions were low-quality.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single line containing the integer −1−1; otherwise, print a single line containing three space-separated integers xx, yy and zz.
Constraints

4≤N≤1004≤N≤100
NN is divisible by 44
0≤Ai≤1000≤Ai≤100 for each valid ii
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000

Explanation
Test case 11: The values x=60,y=75x=60,y=75 and z=90z=90 satisfy all the conditions. Each grade is received by one student each.  

The student with score 2525 gets grade D.  
The student with score 6060 gets grade C.  
The student with score 7575 gets grade B.  
The student with score 9090 gets grade A.  

Test case 22: It can be proven that there exists no tuple that satisfies all the conditions.
Test case 33: The values x=1,y=2x=1,y=2 and z=3z=3 satisfy all the conditions. Each grade is received by one student each.  

The student with score 00 gets grade D.  
The student with score 11 gets grade C.  
The student with score 22 gets grade B.  
The student with score 33 gets grade A.  

Test case 44: It can be proven that there exists no tuple that satisfies all the conditions.
