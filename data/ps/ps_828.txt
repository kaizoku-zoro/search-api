Sasuke and Itachi are playing a game. Sasuke first creates an array AA containing NN positive integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. He then creates a new array BB of length NN such that Bi=gcd(A1,A2,...,Ai)Bi=gcd(A1,A2,...,Ai) for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N. Now, Sasuke gives array BB to Itachi and asks him to find any array AA (with 1≤Ai≤1091≤Ai≤109) such that the given process applied to AA will produce BB. Can you help Itachi solve this problem?
Here, gcdgcd stands for greatest common divisor.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers denoting the array AA you constructed. If no such array AA exists, print −1−1 instead.
Constraints

1≤T≤1031≤T≤103
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤Ai,Bi≤1091≤Ai,Bi≤109
It is guaranteed that sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 5×1055×105.

4 26
-1


Explanation
Test Case 1: One possible answer is [4,26][4,26] because BB can be generated as follows: B=[gcd(4),gcd(4,26)]=[4,2]B=[gcd(4),gcd(4,26)]=[4,2].
Test Case 2: It can be shown that no array AA exists which can produce the given BB.
