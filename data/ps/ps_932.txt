Chef is given a contract to build towers in Chefland which are made by stacking blocks one above the other. Initially, there is only 11 block in the inventory and no tower has been built. Chef follows the following 22 steps in each operation:

Either build a new tower or update an existing tower that has been built in previous operations using any number of blocks currently present in the inventory. After this step, the size of the inventory reduces by the number of blocks used.
Suppose the tower Chef updated or built has BB blocks after the step, Chef gets to add BB new blocks to the inventory as a reward.

Find the maximum number of towers of height XX that Chef can build in MM operations.
Note: Tower of height XX means that the tower consists of XX blocks placed one above the other.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two space separated integers X,MX,M.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of towers that Chef can build.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤X≤1091≤X≤109
0≤M≤10170≤M≤1017

Explanation
Test Cases 11, 22 and 33:

Operation 11: 
Remove 11 block from the inventory and build a new tower of height 11 after which the inventory becomes empty. 
Add 11 block to the inventory after which the inventory has only 11 block.
Operation 22: 
Remove 11 block from the inventory and update the tower of height 11 to 1+1=21+1=2 after which the inventory becomes empty.
Add 22 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 22 blocks.
Operation 33:
Remove 22 blocks from the inventory and build a new tower of height 22 after which the inventory becomes empty.
Add 22 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 22 blocks.

So after operation 11, there is no tower of height 22 built, after operation 22, there is a single tower of height 22 built and after operation 33, 22 towers of height 22 are built.
Test Case 44:

Operation 11: 
Remove 11 block from the inventory and build a new tower of height 11 after which the inventory becomes empty. 
Add 11 block to the inventory after which the inventory has only 11 block.
Operation 22: 
Remove 11 block from the inventory and update the tower of height 11 to 1+1=21+1=2 after which the inventory becomes empty.
Add 22 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 22 blocks.
Operation 33: 
Remove 22 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 22 to 2+2=42+2=4 after which the inventory becomes empty.
Add 44 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 44 blocks.
Operation 44: 
Remove 44 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 44 to 4+4=84+4=8 after which the inventory becomes empty.
Add 88 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 88 blocks.
Operation 55: 
Remove 88 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 88 to 8+8=168+8=16 after which the inventory becomes empty.
Add 1616 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 1616 blocks.
Operation 66: 
Remove 1616 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 1616 to 16+16=3216+16=32 after which the inventory becomes empty.
Add 3232 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has only 3232 blocks.
Operation 77: 
Remove 2121 blocks from the inventory and update the tower of height 3232 to 32+21=5332+21=53 after which the inventory has 32−21=1132−21=11 blocks remaining.
Add 5353 blocks to the inventory after which the inventory has 53+11=6453+11=64 blocks in total.

So after 7th7th operation we are able to achieve one tower of height 5353.
