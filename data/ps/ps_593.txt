You are given an integer NN. Construct a permutation AA of length NN which is attractive.
A permutation is called attractive if the bitwise XOR of all absolute differences of adjacent pairs of elements is equal to 00.
Formally, a permutation A=[A1,A2,…,AN]A=[A1,A2,…,AN] of length NN is said to be attractive if:
|A1−A2|⊕|A2−A3|⊕…⊕|AN−1−AN|=0|A1−A2|⊕|A2−A3|⊕…⊕|AN−1−AN|=0
where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Output any attractive permutation of length NN. If no attractive permutation exists, print −1−1 instead.
Note: A permutation of length NN is an array A=[A1,A2,…,AN]A=[A1,A2,…,AN] such that every integer from 11 to NN occurs exactly once in AA. For example, [1,2,3][1,2,3] and [2,3,1][2,3,1] are permutations of length 33, but [1,2,1][1,2,1], [4,1,2][4,1,2], and [2,3,1,4][2,3,1,4] are not.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing one integer NN.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line an attractive permutation of NN integers, or −1−1 if no attractive permutation exists.
Constraints

2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
Sum of NN over all cases won't exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

Note that there are other correct answers — for example, [1,2,3][1,2,3] would also be accepted as correct.
