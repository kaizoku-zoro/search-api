You are given two positive integers NN and KK, where K≤NK≤N. Find a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN such that:

for each valid ii, AiAi is either ii or −i−i
there are exactly KK values of ii such that 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N and A1+A2+…+Ai>0A1+A2+…+Ai>0

If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them. It can be proved that at least one solution always exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
