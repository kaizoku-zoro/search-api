Salmon received an array AA of size NN and an array BB of size MM for Christmas. He would like to move all the elements in BB to AA using a special method described below.
While BB is not empty, Salmon does the following operations in order:

Remove and store the leftmost element off of B (let's call this element XX).
Place XX at the start of AA.
Keep swapping XX and the element to the right of it repeatedly until XX is at the rightmost position of AA or XX is greater or equal to the element to the right of it.

Before performing the operations, Salmon can rearrange both A and B in any order once. He would like to do as little work as possible -- determine the minimum possible amount of swaps.
Input:
The first line of input will consist of a two space-separated integers, NN and MM (1≤N,M≤2∗1051≤N,M≤2∗105).
The next line will consist of NN space-separated integers, with the ii-th input representing A[i]A[i] (−109≤A[i]≤109−109≤A[i]≤109).
The next line will consist of MM space-separated integers, with the ii-th input representing B[i]B[i] (−109≤B[i]≤109−109≤B[i]≤109).
Output:
Output a single integer, the minimum number of swaps required.
Subtasks:

Subtask 1 [15 points]: A[i]=1,B[i]=1A[i]=1,B[i]=1 for all ii.
Subtask 2 [30 points]: N,M≤103N,M≤103.
Subtask 3 [55 points]: No additional constraints.

Note:
The answer may be greater than the limit for a 32-bit integer. Use long long instead of int for C++ and long for Java. Please check your language documentation for other languages on how to use 64-bit integers. Note that Python solutions won't encounter a problem as it uses BigIntegers by default.

                        Sample Input 1
                        





5 3
10 5 2 5 4
3 1 2



                        Sample Output 1

Explanation
Salmon can reorder AA to be [2,10,5,4,5][2,10,5,4,5] and BB to be [1,2,3][1,2,3].
