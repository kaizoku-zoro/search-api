Chef recently solved his first problem on CodeChef. The problem he solved has NN test cases. He gets a score for his submission according to the following rules:
1) If Chef’s code passes all the NN test cases, he gets 100100 points.
2) If Chef’s code does not pass all the test cases, but passes all the first M(M<N)M(M<N) test cases, he gets K(K<100)K(K<100) points.
3) If the conditions 11 and 22 are not satisfied, Chef does not get any points (i.e his score remains at 00 points).
You are given a binary array A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN of length NN, where Ai=1Ai=1 denotes Chef's code passed the ithith test case, Ai=0Ai=0 denotes otherwise. You are also given the two integers M,KM,K. Can you find how many points does Chef get?
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N,M,KN,M,K.
The second line contains NN space-separated integer A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the score of Chef.

Explanation
Test case 11: Chef's code neither passes all 44 test cases nor passes the first 22 test cases. Hence he does not get any points.
Test case 22: Chef's code does not pass all 33 test cases, but passes the first 22 test cases. Hence he gets 5050 points.
Test case 33: Chef's code passes all the 44 test cases. Hence he gets 100100 points.
