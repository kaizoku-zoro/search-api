"You have a reason to leave this place, but I don't."
In the fourth game, Sang-Woo and Ali are competing against each other. Sang-Woo is the more intelligent one between them, and he plans to win the game by cheating. Ali is your childhood friend and you want to help him win this game. The game goes as follows.
Both of them are given 22 strings — SS and PP — of equal length (say NN). The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to convert the string PP into SS. Every character of both SS and PP is either a lowercase English alphabet or ??.
First, before performing any operation, you must choose a single lowercase character from the English alphabet, and replace every occurrence of ?? with this character. Note that every ?? present in either SS or PP is replaced by the exact same character. This does not count as an operation.
Once the above step is done, you are allowed to perform the following two operations on PP any number of times:

Pick an index 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N such that PiPi is a vowel, and change PiPi to any consonant.
Pick an index 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N such that PiPi is a consonant, and change PiPi to any vowel.

Note: The vowels are the 55 characters {a,e,i,o,u}{a,e,i,o,u} — the other 2121 are consonants.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert PP into SS.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, denoting the length of strings SS and PP.
The second and third lines contain strings SS and PP respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of operations required to convert PP into SS.
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
The sum of all NN across all test cases does not exceed 5∗1055∗105.
|S|=|P||S|=|P|
Every character of both SS and PP is either a lowercase English alphabet or ??.
Every ?? present in SS and PP should be assigned the same character.

Explanation
Test Case 1: First, replace every ?? by uu. This gives us S=abucuS=abucu and P=aegukP=aeguk. Now PP can be converted to SS as follows:

Convert P2=eP2=e to bb in 1 operation.
Convert P3=gP3=g to uu in 1 operation.
Convert P4=uP4=u to cc in 1 operation.
Convert P5=kP5=k to uu in 1 operation.

Test Case 3: The strings are already equal, so no operations are required.
