A sophomore Computer Science student is frustrated with boring college lectures. Professor X agreed to give him some questions; if the student answers all questions correctly, then minimum attendance criteria will not apply to him.
Professor X chooses a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and asks QQ queries. In each query, the student is given an integer PP; he has to construct a sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN, where P⊕Ai=BiP⊕Ai=Bi for each valid ii (⊕⊕ denotes bitwise XOR), and then he has to find the number of elements of this sequence which have an even number of 11-s in the binary representation and the number of elements with an odd number of 11-s in the binary representation. Help him answer the queries.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
QQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains a single integer PP describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the number of elements with an even number of 11-s and the number of elements with an odd number of 11-s in the binary representation.

Explanation
Example case 1: The elements of the sequence BB are P⊕4=7P⊕4=7, P⊕2=1P⊕2=1, P⊕15=12P⊕15=12, P⊕9=10P⊕9=10, P⊕8=11P⊕8=11 and P⊕8=11P⊕8=11. The elements which have an even number of 11-s in the binary representation are 1212 and 1010, while the elements with an odd number of 11-s are 77, 11, 1111 and 1111.
