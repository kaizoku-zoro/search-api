An NN-bonacci sequence is an infinite sequence F1,F2,…F1,F2,… such that for each integer i>Ni>N, FiFi is calculated as f(Fi−1,Fi−2,…,Fi−N)f(Fi−1,Fi−2,…,Fi−N), where ff is some function. A XOR NN-bonacci sequence is an NN-bonacci sequence for which f(Fi−1,Fi−2,…,Fi−N)=Fi−1⊕Fi−2⊕…⊕Fi−Nf(Fi−1,Fi−2,…,Fi−N)=Fi−1⊕Fi−2⊕…⊕Fi−N, where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Recently, Chef has found an interesting sequence S1,S2,…S1,S2,…, which is obtained from prefix XORs of a XOR NN-bonacci sequence F1,F2,…F1,F2,…. Formally, for each positive integer ii, Si=F1⊕F2⊕…⊕FiSi=F1⊕F2⊕…⊕Fi. You are given the first NN elements of the sequence FF, which uniquely determine the entire sequence SS.
You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given an index kk and you should calculate SkSk. It is guaranteed that in each query, SkSk does not exceed 10501050.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers F1,F2,…,FNF1,F2,…,FN.
The following QQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer kk.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer SkSk.
