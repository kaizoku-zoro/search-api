JJ loves playing with medians. He has an array AA of length NN (NN is odd). He wants to partition the array AA into two non-empty subsets PP and QQ such that the value of |median(P)−median(Q)||median(P)−median(Q)| is as small as possible. (Note that each AiAi must belong to either subset PP or subset QQ).
Help him find this minimum value of |median(P)−median(Q)||median(P)−median(Q)|.
As a reminder, the median of a subset XX of size NN is the element which occupies the ⌊N+12⌋th⌊N+12⌋th position after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example, median([3,1,4])=3median([3,1,4])=3, median([3,1,4,2])=2median([3,1,4,2])=2. (Here ⌊x⌋⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer which does not exceed xx).
Input Format

The first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN - the size of the array AA.
The second line of each test case contains NN space separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN denoting the array AA.

Output Format
Output the minimum value of |median(P)−median(Q)||median(P)−median(Q)|.
Constraints

Explanation

Test case 11: We can divide the array into following two subsets: P=[2,8],Q=[7,4,2]P=[2,8],Q=[7,4,2], which has |median(P)−median(Q)|=|2−4|=2|median(P)−median(Q)|=|2−4|=2. It can be proven that the answer can not be improved further.
Test case 22: We can divide the array into following two subsets: P=[1,3],Q=[2]P=[1,3],Q=[2], which has |median(P)−median(Q)|=|1−2|=1|median(P)−median(Q)|=|1−2|=1. It can be proven that the answer can not be improved further.
Test case 33: Observe that, for any partition of the array into any two non-empty subsets, the median of both the subsets will be 11. Therefore the answer is |1−1|=0|1−1|=0.
