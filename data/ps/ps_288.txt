Chef and Paja are bored, so they are playing an infinite game of ping pong. The rules of the game are as follows:

The players play an infinite number of games. At the end of each game, the player who won it scores a point.
In each game, one of the players serves. Chef serves in the first game.
After every KK points are scored (regardless of which players scored them), i.e. whenever KK games have been played since the last time the serving player changed, the player that serves in the subsequent games changes: if Chef served in the game that just finished, then Paja will serve in the next game and all subsequent games until the serving player changes again; if Paja served, then Chef will serve.

The players got a little too caught up in the game and they forgot who is supposed to serve in the next game. Will you help them determine that? So far, Chef has scored XX points and Paja has scored YY points.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers XX, YY and KK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chef" if Chef is supposed to serve next or "Paja" otherwise (without quotes).
