A permutation of length NN is an array of NN integers P=[P1,P2,…,PN]P=[P1,P2,…,PN] such that every integer from 11 to NN (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. For example, [2,3,4,1][2,3,4,1] is a permutation of length 44.
A subsegment of an array A[L…R]=[AL,AL+1,…,ARA[L…R]=[AL,AL+1,…,AR] is called good if the subsegment is a permutation of length (R−L+1)(R−L+1). For example, the array A=[2,3,1,4,2]A=[2,3,1,4,2] contains 33 good subsegments: A[3…3]=[1],A[3…3]=[1], A[1…3]A[1…3] =[2,3,1],=[2,3,1], A[2…5]=[3,1,4,2]A[2…5]=[3,1,4,2].
You are given two integers NN and KK. Find a permutation of length NN such that it contains exactly KK good subsegments. Print -1 if no such permutation exists.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow:
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,KN,K.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer:

If no permutation satisfies the given conditions, print −1.
Otherwise, print NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN, denoting the elements of the permutation. If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.

Explanation
Test case 11: The only permutation of length 11 is [1][1], which contains one good subsegment A[1…1]A[1…1].
Test case 22: The permutation [1,3,2][1,3,2] contains 22 good subsegments: A[1…1]A[1…1], A[1…3]A[1…3].
Test case 33: There is no way to construct a permutation of length 44 which contains one good subsegment.
Test case 44: The permutation [5,3,1,4,2][5,3,1,4,2] contains 33 good subsegments: A[3…3],A[2…5],A[1…5]A[3…3],A[2…5],A[1…5]. There are other permutations of length 55 having 33 good subsegments.
