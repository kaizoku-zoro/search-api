In computing, the collection of four bits is called a nibble.
Chef defines a program as:

Good, if it takes exactly $X$ nibbles of memory, where $X$ is a positive integer.
Not Good, otherwise.

Given a program which takes $N$ bits of memory, determine whether it is Good or Not Good.
Input Format

First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$, the number of bits taken by the program.

Output Format
For each test case, output $\texttt{Good}$ or $\texttt{Not Good}$ in a single line.
You may print each character of $\texttt{Good}$ or $\texttt{Not Good}$ in uppercase or lowercase (for example, $\texttt{GoOd}$, $\texttt{GOOD}$, $\texttt{good}$ will be considered identical).
Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 1000$
$1 \leq N \leq 1000$

Subtasks

Explanation
Test case 1: The program requires $8$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{8}{4} = 2$ nibbles. Since $2$ is an integer, this program is good.
Test case 2: The program requires $17$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{17}{4} = 4.25$ nibbles. Since $4.25$ is not an integer, this program is not good.
Test case 3: The program requires $52$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{52}{4} = 13$ nibbles. Since $13$ is an integer, this program is good.
Test case 4: The program requires $3$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$ nibbles. Since $0.75$ is not an integer, this program is not good.
