You are given an integer sequence AA with length NN. In one move, you are allowed to choose one element of this sequence and change it to an arbitrary integer. Compute the minimum number of moves needed to make the sequence a permutation of the integers 11 through NN.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of moves.

Explanation
Example case 1: One possible way is to change the last element to 44. This creates the sequence 1,2,3,41,2,3,4, which is a permutation.
Example case 2: We can change the first element to 11 and the second element to 33, creating the permutation 1,3,21,3,2.
