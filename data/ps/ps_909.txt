Jonas asked Martha to stand at point (x1,y1)(x1,y1) on an infinite cartesian plane. He gave her a string SS which consists of operations in the form of characters 'R', 'L', 'U', and 
'D'.
Each character of the string corresponds to the following movements: 

'R' means moving right by 11 unit i.e, (x,y)(x,y) to (x+1,y)(x+1,y).
'L' means moving left by 11 unit i.e, (x,y)(x,y) to (x−1,y)(x−1,y).
'U' means moving up by 11 unit i.e, (x,y)(x,y) to (x,y+1)(x,y+1).
'D' means moving down by 11 unit i.e, (x,y)(x,y) to (x,y−1)(x,y−1).

Now, Jonas asks Martha QQ queries. In each query, coordinates are given of form (x2,y2)(x2,y2). Martha needs to tell if it is possible to move from (x1,y1)(x1,y1) to (x2,y2)(x2,y2) by choosing a subsequence of given string SS and performing the operations in sequential order.Starting point (x1,y1)(x1,y1) remains same for all queries.
If it is possible, print "YES" and the length of the smallest possible subsequence of string, else print "NO".
Recall that string aa is a subsequence of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly zero or all) characters. For example, for the string aa="codechef", the following strings are subsequences: "code", "ee", "odchef", "df", "", and others, but the following are not subsequences: "ced", "eehc", "cofe".
Note: Use of Fast IO is recommended.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then test cases follow.
For each test case, first line will contain string SS, string of operations.
Second line will contain coordinates x1x1 and y1y1.
Third line will contain QQ, number of queries.
QQ lines follow. Each line will contain coordinates x2x2 and y2y2.

Output:
For each query if subsequence exists then print "YES" (without quotes) and length of smallest possible subsequence separated by a space in new line, else print "NO" (without quotes) in new line.

Explanation
Given String is "RLUDRLUD", (x1,y1)(x1,y1) is (1,2)(1,2). We can move from (1,2)(1,2) to (2,3)(2,3) in just two operations if we choose subsequence as "RU" or "UR".
Suppose we choose "RU" as a subsequence. 'R' means moving from (1,2)(1,2) to (2,2)(2,2). 'U' means moving from (2,2)(2,2) to (2,3)(2,3).
In the second query, we can't move from (1,2) to (1,-2) using operations of the given string.
