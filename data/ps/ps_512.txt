Read problems statements in Russian and Bengali.
You are given an integer NN. Output a permutation of values from 11 to NN that satisfies the following condition:

gcd([1+A1,2+A2,3+A3,…,N+AN])>1gcd([1+A1,2+A2,3+A3,…,N+AN])>1

It can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple permutations that can satisfy the condition, then output any one of them.
As a reminder,

A permutation of values from 11 to NN is an array containing integers from 11 to NN in any order but each of them appearing exactly once.
GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. The greatest common divisor of a sequence is the largest integer dd such that all the numbers in sequence are divisible by dd. For more information, refer to here.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN.

Output Format
For each test case, output on one line a permutation of values from 11 to NN which satisfies the above condition.

3 4 1 2


Explanation

For the first test case, gcd([1+3,2+4,3+1,4+2])=gcd([4,6,4,6])=2gcd([1+3,2+4,3+1,4+2])=gcd([4,6,4,6])=2 which is greater than 11, so the given permutation satisfies the condition.
