It's well known that our friend Balsa likes the digit 33 very much. He's so obsessed with this digit that he spends time thinking about it even during holidays.
Today, Balsa invented an interesting problem: For a positive integer NN, find the smallest integer greater than NN such that its decimal representation contains the digit 33 at least three times.
You are given the integer NN. Please solve this problem for Balsa.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the smallest number greater than NN containing the digit 33 at least three times.
