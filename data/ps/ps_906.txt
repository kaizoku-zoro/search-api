Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

You are given an array A of integers of size N. You will be given Q queries where each query is represented by two integers L, R. You have to find the gcd(Greatest Common Divisor) of the array after excluding the part from range L to R inclusive (1 Based indexing). You are guaranteed that after excluding the part of the array 
remaining array is non empty.
 
Input
First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.  
For each test case, first line will contain two space separated integers N, Q.  
 Next line contains N space separated integers denoting array A. 
For next Q lines, each line will contain a query denoted by two space separated integers L, R. 
Output
For each query, print a single integer representing the answer of that query.

Constraints

Subtask #1: 40 points
2 ≤ T, N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Q ≤ N, 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ L, R ≤ N and L ≤ R

Subtask #2: 60 points
2 ≤ T, N ≤ 105, 1 ≤ Q ≤ N, 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ L, R ≤ N and L ≤ R
 Sum of N over all the test cases will be less than or equal to 106.

Warning :  Large IO(input output), please use faster method for IO.

Explanation
Test case 11: The given array is [2,6,9][2,6,9].

Query 11: On excluding the range [1,1][1,1], the remaining elements are [6,9][6,9]. The gcd of 66 and 99 is 33.
Query 22: On excluding the range [2,2][2,2], the remaining elements are [2,9][2,9]. The gcd of 22 and 99 is 11.
Query 33: On excluding the range [2,3][2,3], the remaining elements are [2][2]. The gcd of 22 is 22.
