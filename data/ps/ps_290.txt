You are given a sortedsorted list AA of size  NN.You have to make a new list BB such that B[i]B[i] is equal to the number of elements strictlystrictly greatergreater than A[i]A[i] in the list AA.
Print the newnew listlist.
Input
The first line consists of  TT, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of one integer denoting NN, where NN is the size of the list given to you.
Second line of each test case contains the list given to you   containing NN elements.
Output
For each test case print the list in a single line and the elements of the list should be separated by  spacespace.
Print the answer to eacheach test case in a newnew lineline.
Constraints
 1≤T≤1001≤T≤100 , where TT is the number of test cases. 
 1≤N≤1001≤N≤100, where NN is the number of elements in the list.
1≤A[i]≤10000001≤A[i]≤1000000 ,where A[i]A[i] is the  ithith element in  the list given to you.
Subtasks
1515 pointspoints: All the elements in the list given to you are distinct.
3535 pointspoints: Original constraints: Elements can be repeated in the list.

3 2 0 0
4 0 0 0 0


Explanation
 The explanation for test case 1 of sample input :
The first element in the new list is 3 since the first element in the previous list was 1, and there are three elements which are strictly greater than 1, that is 2, 4 and 4.
The second element in the new list is 2 since the second element in the previous list was 2, and there are two elements which are strictly greater than 2, that is 4 and 4.
The third and fourth element in the new list is 0  since third and fourth element in the previous list was  4 and there are no elements which are strictly greater than them.
