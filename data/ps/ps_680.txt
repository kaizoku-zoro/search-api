A tennis tournament is about to take place with NN players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single integer NN denoting number of players.

Output:

If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print NN lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size NN. 
If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between ii and jj , ii wins. 
You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.
