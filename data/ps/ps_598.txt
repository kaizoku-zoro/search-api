Mr. Pr and Ms. Ad are at aa and bb respectively on an infinite number line. Mr. Pr wants to meet Ms. Ad.
Mr. Pr can choose to move  cc or dd units in 1 second. If Mr. Pr moves cc units then Ms. Ad will move dd units and vice versa. (Both of them always moved in positive x-direction)
You have to determine if Mr. Pr can meet with Ms. Ad after some integral amount of time, given that Mr. Pr chooses optimally. Note that meeting after a fractional amount of time does not count.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains four space separated integers, aa, bb, cc, and dd.

Output:

For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if Mr. Pr meets with Ms. Ad, otherwise "NO".

YES
NO


Explanation
In the first test case, Mr. Pr will move 2 units in the first second and Ms. Ad moves 1 unit simultaneously and they meet. 
In the second test case, it is impossible to meet (fractional time is not allowed).
