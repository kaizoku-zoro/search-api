Vanja and Miksi have already finished everything for this year at their university, so they decided to spend their free time playing a game with a binary sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN (i.e. a sequence containing only integers 00 and 11).
At the beginning of the game, Vanja and Miksi write down the expression ∗A1∗A2∗A3∗…∗AN∗A1∗A2∗A3∗…∗AN (note below that each ∗∗ is a placeholder and does not denote multiplication).
The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja. The game lasts NN turns. In each turn, the current player must replace the first (leftmost) remaining ∗∗ by the sign ++ or −− (or, equivalently, by the operation of addition or subtraction).
After the last turn, the boys calculate the resulting value VV of the expression. If |V|≥K|V|≥K, the winner is Vanja; otherwise, the winner is Miksi.
Please predict the winner of the game if both players play optimally. 
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — 11 if Vanja (the first player) is the winner or 22 if Miksi (the second player) is the winner.

Explanation
Example case 1: K=1K=1, so if Vanja replaces the first ∗∗ by ++, the value of the final expression will be V=1V=1; then, K≤|V|K≤|V|, so the winner is Vanja.
Example case 2: K=5K=5, but the absolute value of the final expression cannot be greater than 11. The winner is Miksi.
