You are given an integer KK.
Consider an integer sequence A=[A1,A2,…,AN]A=[A1,A2,…,AN].
Define another sequence SS of length NN, such that Si=A1+A2+…+AiSi=A1+A2+…+Ai for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N.
AA is said to be interesting if Ai+Si=KAi+Si=K for every 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N.
Find the maximum length of an interesting sequence. If there are no interesting sequences, print 00.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, which contains a single integer KK.

Output Format

For each test case, print a new line containing one integer — the maximum length of an interesting sequence for a given value of KK.

Explanation
Test Case 11: Consider the sequence A=[4,2,1]A=[4,2,1]. S=[4,4+2,4+2+1]=[4,6,7]S=[4,4+2,4+2+1]=[4,6,7]. 
The sum of the corresponding elements of AA and SS are 4+4=84+4=8, 2+6=82+6=8 and 1+7=81+7=8. Thus AA is an interesting sequence of size 33.  
Test Case 22: Consider the sequence A=[2,1]A=[2,1]. S=[2,2+1]=[2,3]S=[2,2+1]=[2,3]. 
The sum of the corresponding elements of AA and SS are 2+2=42+2=4 and 1+3=41+3=4. Thus AA is an interesting sequence of size 22.
It's guaranteed that, in both examples above, there doesn't exist a longer sequence satisfying the problem constraints.
