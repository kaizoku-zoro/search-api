Tzuyu gave Nayeon a strip of NN cells (numbered 11 through NN) for her birthday. This strip is described by a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, where for each valid ii, the ii-th cell is blocked if Ai=1Ai=1 or free if Ai=0Ai=0. Tzuyu and Nayeon are going to use it to play a game with the following rules:

The players alternate turns; Nayeon plays first.
Initially, both players are outside of the strip. However, note that afterwards during the game, their positions are always different.
In each turn, the current player should choose a free cell and move there. Afterwards, this cell becomes blocked and the players cannot move to it again.
If it is the current player's first turn, she may move to any free cell.
Otherwise, she may only move to one of the left and right adjacent cells, i.e. from a cell cc, the current player may only move to the cell c−1c−1 or c+1c+1 (if it is free).
If a player is unable to move to a free cell during her turn, this player loses the game.

Nayeon and Tzuyu are very smart, so they both play optimally. Since it is Nayeon's birthday, she wants to know if she can beat Tzuyu. Find out who wins.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Nayeon wins the game or "No" if Tzuyu wins (without quotes).

Explanation
Example case 1: Since both Nayeon and Tzuyu play optimally, Nayeon can start e.g. by moving to cell 44, which then becomes blocked. Tzuyu has to pick either the cell 33 or the cell 55, which also becomes blocked. Nayeon is then left with only one empty cell next to cell 44 (the one Tzuyu did not pick); after she moves there, Tzuyu is unable to move, so she loses the game.
Example case 2: Regardless of what cell Nayeon moves to at the start, Tzuyu will always be able to beat her.
